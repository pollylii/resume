## MISC

Many friends email me to learn how to make such a resume. In fact, you only need to fork the project and try to run the project!

Because the MVVM framework is numerous and constantly updated, the previous version (angular1.6) has been deprecated, and finally chose to implement [an MVVM framework](https://github.com/zhaoky/mvvm) to serve this project.
